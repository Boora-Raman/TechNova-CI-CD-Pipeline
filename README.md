## âœ… Contribution Rules

1. **Create Your Own Branch**

   * Each member must work in a **personal branch named after yourself**
     *Example*: `raman-boora`, `dhruv`,`sidharth`
   * Do **all your work and commits in your own branch**

2. **Raise Pull Requests to `main` When Ready**

   * When your feature or task is ready for review or merge, raise a **Pull Request (PR)** from your branch to the `main` branch
   * You can also raise a PR to **get early feedback** even if your work is still in progress
   * This keeps collaboration flexible but still organized

3. **Never Push Directly to `main`**

   * The `main` branch is protected to keep the project stable
   * All updates must go through **Pull Requests** for review and approval
